# Memory Log: 2026-02-03 - TrustFlow Launch Session

## Summary of Operational Cycle

This session focused on transitioning the "Truth Revolution" strategic concept into a functional, version-controlled product named **TrustFlow**. We successfully defined the core product, the Decisional Verification Protocol (DVP), and established Git resilience, but faced significant friction with environment configuration and tooling.

## Key Decisions
- **Project Name:** TrustFlow (P0 Branding Constraint Resolution).
- **Product MVP:** DVP CLI (Confidence 0.630, ready for Final Motion).
- **Core Governance:** Reputational Governance Protocol (RGP) formalized in PROTOCOL.md.
- **Remote Repo:** git@github.com:cassianluc999/TrustFlow.git (Secured via PAT-push).
- **Aesthetic Solution:** DVP Dashboard presented in a browser tab via `openclaw browser:open` on the manually started Node.

## Operational Friction Log (Must Fix)
- **Visualization:** `canvas:present` is blocked due to non-running Node/Browser services. Requires persistent SSH/Host configuration for clean startup.
- **Git/SSH:** Unable to use secure SSH access due to Windows `ssh-agent` service being disabled/unreachable. Required temporary use of PAT. **P1 Fix: Implement permanent SSH capability.**
- **CLI Syntax:** Frequent failure to use Windows-native command separators. **Fix: Model refinement needed for host OS context.**

## Next Strategic Task
- **P1:** Formalize the Marketing Strategy for TrustFlow (Target Audience, Core Narrative).
- **P1:** Log Final Motion Approval for the DVP CLI MVP.
