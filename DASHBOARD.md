## 🏗️ Core Architecture Status: Decisional Verification Protocol (DVP)

The DVP is implemented in Python and functional. The project is currently blocked on **Aesthetic/GUI Presentation** (waiting for Node pairing).

| Component | Status | File Reference | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DVP Schema** | ✅ READY | [PROJECT.md](./PROJECT.md) | Data model for verifiable claims. |
| **RGP Rules** | ✅ READY | [PROTOCOL.md](./PROTOCOL.md) | Scoring logic for Confidence (Process Transparency). |
| **Core Model** | ✅ READY | [src/dvp_model.py](./src/dvp_model.py) | Python implementation validated. |
| **DVP CLI** | ✅ MVP | [src/sl_cli.py](./src/sl_cli.py) | Ready for live use. |
| **Aesthetic Spec** | ✅ DESIGNED | [GUI_SPEC.md](./GUI_SPEC.md) | Ready for visualization implementation. |

## 📋 Next Execution Step: Unblock Visualization

The critical path requires us to solve the aesthetic constraint before moving to the next strategic DVP.

| Task | Status | Priority | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Pair External Node** | ⬜ PENDING | P0 | REQUIRED: Install Companion App and pair device using the Gateway URL. |
| **2. Present Dashboard** | ⬜ PENDING | P0 | Fulfill the aesthetic requirement. |
| **3. Log Final Motion** | ⬜ PENDING | P1 | Finalize DVP-37a once the GUI path is clear. |
